biotech,2005-06-13,2023-01-03,DB00001,Lepirudin,"Lepirudin is a recombinant hirudin formed by 65 amino acids that acts as a highly specific and direct thrombin inhibitor.[L41539,L41569] Natural hirudin is an endogenous anticoagulant found in _Hirudo medicinalis_ leeches.[L41539] Lepirudin is produced in yeast cells and is identical to natural hirudin except for the absence of sulfate on the tyrosine residue at position 63 and the substitution of leucine for isoleucine at position 1 (N-terminal end).[A246609] 

Lepirudin is used as an anticoagulant in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), an immune reaction associated with a high risk of thromboembolic complications.[A3, L41539] HIT is caused by the expression of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that bind to the complex formed by heparin and platelet factor 4. This activates endothelial cells and platelets and enhances the formation of thrombi.[A246609] Bayer ceased the production of lepirudin (Refludan) effective May 31, 2012.[L41574]",138068-37-8,Y43GF64R34,solid,approved withdrawn,"Recombinant hirudin expressed by using yeast secretary (China Patent No. CN1371994A, 2001). China National Intellectual Property Administration. https://patents.google.com/patent/CN1371994A/en","Lepirudin is indicated for anticoagulation in adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) such as unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction without ST elevation. In patients with ACS, lepirudin is intended for use with [aspirin].[L41539] Lepirudin is also indicated for anticoagulation in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and associated thromboembolic disease in order to prevent further thromboembolic complications.[L41539]","Lepirudin is a recombinant hirudin that acts as a highly specific thrombin inhibitor. Its activity is measured by anti-thrombin units (ATUs) that correspond to the amount of lepirudin required to neutralize a unit of the World Health Organization α-thrombin (89/588) standard. The activity of lepirudin is 16,000 ATU/mg.[L41539,L41569] A single molecule of lepirudin binds to a molecule of thrombin, blocking its thrombogenic activity. This drug increases activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)  and PT (INR) values in a dose-dependent manner, and its mode of action is independent of antithrombin III.[L41539,L41569] Platelet factor 4 does not inhibit lepirudin.[L41539,L41569]

The pharmacodynamic effect of lepirudin was evaluated by measuring an increase in aPTT. No saturable effect was observed at the highest tested dose (0.5 mg/kg, IV bolus).[L41539] Thrombin time was considered an unsuitable routine test for lepirudin monitoring due to the high values detected (200 seconds) even at low doses.[L41539] The concomitant use of thrombolytic therapy and lepirudin is not recommended due to the high risk of bleeding that may be life-threatening. In patients with a risk of bleeding, a physician should weigh the risks of lepirudin administration against its benefits.  There is also an especially high risk of bleeding in patients who weigh less than 50 kg, and a lower dosage is required. Patients with renal impairment have a higher risk of hemorrhagic adverse events.[L41539]","Lepirudin is a direct thrombin inhibitor used as an anticoagulant in patients for whom heparin is contraindicated.[L41539,A3] Thrombin is a serine protease that participates in the blood-clotting cascade, and it is formed by the cleavage of pro-thrombin. Active thrombin cleaves fibrinogen and generates fibrin monomers that polymerize to form fibrin clots.[A246624]

Lepirudin binds to the catalytic and substrate-binding sites of thrombin, forming a stable, irreversible and non-covalent complex.[A246609] This blocks the protease activity of thrombin and inhibits the coagulation process. Each molecule of lepirudin binds to a single molecule of thrombin,[L41539] and unlike [heparin], it is able to inhibit thrombin in both its clot-bound or free states.[A246609]","The acute toxicity of intravenous lepirudin was evaluated in mice (0.1-1000 mg/kg), rats (1-1000 mg/kg), and monkeys (1-100 mg/kg), and toxicity was not detected at the doses investigated.[L41539] The acute toxicity of lepirudin administered subcutaneously was also evaluated in mice (1-1250 mg/kg) and rats (1-500 mg/kg), and no toxicity was detected.[L41539] One rat (100 mg/kg) died of rapid blood loss after the subcutaneous administration of lepirudin. Reactions to local injections such as hemorrhages, hematomas and/or nodules were detected in mice and rats given subcutaneous doses of lepirudin equal or higher than 500 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively.[L41539] 

Chronic toxicity was evaluated in rats and monkeys given lepirudin for up to 3 months. Most of the effects observed were due to the antithrombotic action of lepirudin. After 3 months, hemosiderin deposits in the spleen and moderate sinus histiocytosis in the lymph node were observed in rats. In monkeys, external and internal hemorrhages and hematomas were detected.[L41539] Lepidurin was reported as not mutagenic.[L41539]

Relative overdose may occur in patients with renal impairment, therefore, bolus dose and rate of infusion must be reduced in case of known or suspected renal insufficiency.[L41539] Excessively high activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) values suggest an overdose and a risk of bleeding. Lepirudin has no known antidote. In case of life-threatening bleeding and if excessive plasma levels of lepirudin are suspected: 1)stop the administration of lepirudin immediately, 2) determine aPTT and coagulation parameters, 3) determine hemoglobin, and prepare for a transfusion, 4) follow the treatment guidelines for patients with shock.[L41539] Hemofiltration or hemodialysis may be useful in case of overdose, based in single case reports and animal data.[L41539]","As a polypeptide, lepirudin is expected to be metabolized by the sequential cleavage of amino acids by kidney exoproteases, which have carboxypeptidase and dipeptidase-like activity.[L41539,L41544] The C-terminal cleavage of lepirudin aminoacids (aminoacids 1 to 65) produces four metabolites with anti-thrombotic activity: M1 (aminoacids 1 to 64), M2 (aminoacids 1 to 63), M3 (aminoacids 1 to 62), and M4 (aminoacids 1 to 61).[L41544]","Lepirudin administered as a single intravenous bolus injection of 0.4 mg/kg in 9 healthy volunteers (male and female) resulted in a C<sub>max</sub> of 2924 ng/mL, a t<sub>max</sub> of 0.17 h and an AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> of 2500 ng•h/mL.[L41539] When 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2 mg/kg of lepirudin was administered as a single intravenous infusion over 6 hours in healthy male volunteers, lepirudin had a corresponding C<sub>max</sub> of 111, 203, and 2446 ng/mL and a corresponding AUC of 612, 1184, and 1446 ng•h/mL.[L41544] Bioavailability is 100% following injection. Also, it has been reported that following subcutaneous (sc) administration, the bioavailability of lepirudin is almost 100%.[A246609]","Lepirudin has an initial half-life of approximately 10 minutes, and in young healthy volunteers, it has a terminal half-time of 1.3 hours.[L41539] Lepirudin has a first-order elimination kinetic; plasma concentration increases proportionally as the lepirudin intravenous dose is increased. Elimination half-life values of up to 2 days were detected in patients with marked renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min).[L41539]","In human plasma, the protein binding of lepirudin was approximately 3%.[L41539]","Lepirudin is mostly excreted through urine (48.3%). About 35% of lepirudin is excreted unchanged, while metabolites are found in a smaller proportion (2.5% of M1, 5.4% of M2, 3.9% of M3 and 1.6% of M4).[L41544]","The volume of distribution of lepirudin at steady state was 12.2 L in healthy young subjects (n=18, 18-60 years), 18.7 L in healthy elderly subjects (n=10, 65-80 years), 18.0 L in renally impaired subjects (n=16, creatinine clearance < 80 mL/min, and 32.1 L in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia patients (n=73).[L41539] The distribution of lepirudin is mainly restricted to extracellular fluids.[L41539]","The clearance of lepirudin is proportional to the glomerular filtration rate. On average, lepirudin clearance was 164 mL/min in healthy young subjects (n=18, 18-60 years) and 25% lower in women than in men. In healthy elderly subjects (n=10, 65-80 years), clearance was 139 mL/min, about 20% lower than in younger patients.[L41539] This is possibly due to the lower creatinine clearance in elderly patients. In renally impaired subjects (n=16, creatinine clearance < 80 mL/min), clearance was 61 mL/min, and in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia patients (n=73), it was 114 mL/min.[L41539]",BLOOD AND BLOOD FORMING ORGANS ANTITHROMBOTIC AGENTS Direct thrombin inhibitors,,,"Avoid herbs and supplements with anticoagulant/antiplatelet activity.

biotech,2005-06-13,2023-01-03,DB00002,Cetuximab,"Cetuximab is a recombinant chimeric human/mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody that competitively binds to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and competitively inhibits the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF).[A227973] EGFR is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases found in both normal and tumour cells; it is responsible for regulating epithelial tissue development and homeostasis.[A228083] EGFR has been implicated in various types of cancer, as it is often overexpressed in malignant cells [A227973] and EGFR overexpression has been linked to more advanced disease and poor prognosis.[A227963] EGFR is often mutated in certain types of cancer and serves as a driver of tumorigenesis.[A228083] _In vitro_, cetuximab was shown to mediate anti-tumour effects in numerous cancer cell lines and human tumour xenografts.[A227963]

Approved by the FDA in February 2004 under the brand name ERBITUX, cetuximab is used for the treatment of head and neck cancer and metastatic, KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer, and metastatic colorectal cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation.[A227963,L39045] It has also been investigated in advanced colorectal cancer, EGFR-expressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and unresectable squamous cell skin cancer.[L31418] Cetuximab is administered via intravenous infusion and is used as monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapies, including platinum agents, radiation therapy, [leucovorin], [fluorouracil], and [irinotecan].[L30448]",205923-56-4,PQX0D8J21J,liquid,approved,,"Cetuximab indicated for the treatment of locally or regionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in combination with radiation therapy. It is indicated for treating a recurrent locoregional disease or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in combination with platinum-based therapy with fluorouracil. It is indicated for recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck progressing after platinum-based therapy.[L30448]

Cetuximab is also indicated for K-Ras wild-type, EGFR-expressing, metastatic colorectal cancer as determined by an FDA-approved test in combination with FOLFIRI, a chemotherapy combination that includes [leucovorin], [fluorouracil], and [irinotecan]; in combination with irinotecan in patients who are refractory to irinotecan-based chemotherapy; or as monotherapy in patients who have failed oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy or who are intolerant to irinotecan.[L30448]

Additionally, cetuximab is also indicated for metastatic colorectal cancer that is BRAF V600E mutation-positive (as determined by an FDA-approved test) in combination with [encorafenib] but only after prior therapy.[L39045]

Cetuximab is not indicated for the treatment of Ras-mutant colorectal cancer or when the results of the Ras mutation tests are unknown.[L30448]","Cetuximab is an anticancer agent that works by inhibiting the growth and survival of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing tumour cells with high specificity and higher affinity than epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α), which are natural ligands of EGFR.[L31418] Cetuximab works by inhibiting the growth and survival of EGFR-positive tumours.[A227963] _In vitro_, it promotes antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against certain human tumour types. On the contrary, cetuximab does not exert its anti-tumour effects on human tumour xenografts lacking EGFR expression.[A227963, L30448]

Cetuximab potentiates the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutics and radiation therapy when used in combination.[L30448] In human tumour xenograft models in mice, cetuximab and irinotecan synergistically inhibited the growth of orthotopic anaplastic thyroid carcinoma xenografts _in vitro_ and _in vivo_. Cetuximab potentiated the _in vitro_ anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effect of irinotecan and achieved 93% _in vivo_ inhibition of tumour growth when combined with irinotecan, compared to 77% and 79% inhibition when cetuximab and irinotecan were used alone, respectively.[A227978]","The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane glycoprotein and a type I receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on both normal and malignant cells. It has been investigated as a therapeutic target for anticancer treatment, as it is often upregulated in cancer types, including head and neck, colon, and rectal cancers.[L30448] When activated by its ligand, EGFR undergoes a conformational change and dimerization to form homodimers or heterodimers with another member of the ErbB family of receptors. Dimerization of EGFR activates the intracellular tyrosine kinase region of EGFR and promotes autophosphorylation, initiating a series of downstream signalling cascades, including cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. This EGFR signalling pathway is often dysregulated in cancer cells, leading to aberrant cell growth and enhanced cell survival.[L31418]

Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the EGFR on both normal and tumour cells to competitively inhibit the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other ligands that are produced by normal and tumour tissue epithelial cells.[A11, L30448] Upon binding to domain III of EGFR - which is the binding site for its growth factor ligands - cetuximab prevents the receptor from adopting an extended conformation and thereby inhibits EGFR activation, as well as phosphorylation and activation of receptor-associated kinases (MAPK, PI3K/Akt, Jak/Stat).[A11, A228078] Inhibition of the EGFR signalling pathway ultimately leads to inhibition of cell cycle progression, cell survival pathways, and tumour cell motility and invasion.[A227963] Cetuximab also induces cell apoptosis and decreases matrix metalloproteinase and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production.[A228078, L30448] _In vitro_, cetuximab was shown to inhibit tumour angiogenesis.[A227978] Binding of cetuximab to EGFR also results in internalization of the antibody-receptor complex, leading to an overall downregulation of EGFR expression.[A227973]

K-ras is a small G-protein downstream of EGFR that plays an important role in promoting the EGFR signalling cascade: in some malignant cells, K-ras can acquire activating mutations in exon 2 [L31418] and thus be continuously active regardless of EGFR regulation.[L30448] Since mutant Ras proteins can isolate the pathway from the effect of EGFR, K-Ras mutations can render EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab ineffective in exerting anti-tumour effects.[L30448, L31418] Cetuximab is thus only limited in its use for K-Ras wild-type, EGFR-expressing cancers.[L30448]","The intravenous LD<sub>50</sub> is > 300 mg/kg in mice and > 200 mg/kg in rats.[L31408] There is limited information on the overdose from cetuximab.

In clinical trials, cetuximab was associated with serious and fatal infusion reactions, cardiopulmonary arrest or sudden death, and serious dermatologic toxicities. Pulmonary toxicities, such as interstitial lung disease, interstitial pneumonitis with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and exacerbation of pre-existing fibrotic lung disease have been reported.[L30448]","Like other monoclonal antibodies, cetuximab is expected to undergo lysosomal degradation by the reticuloendothelial system and protein catabolism by a target‐mediated disposition pathway.[A40006]","After administration of a 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> initial dose followed by a 250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly dose, the steady-state levels of cetuximab was reached by the third weekly infusion with mean peak and trough concentrations across studies ranging from 168 µg/mL to 235 µg/mL and 41 µg/mL to 85 µg/mL, respectively.[L30448] T<sub>max</sub> is about 3 hours.[A227963]","After administration of a 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> initial dose followed by a 250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly dose, the mean half-life for cetuximab was approximately 112 hours, with a range of 63 to 230 hours.[L30448]",There is no information available.,There is limited information available.,The volume of the distribution is about 2-3 L/m<sup>2</sup> and is independent of dose.[L30448],"In patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, the estimated clearance rate was 0.103 L/h.[A228003] At doses ranging from 200 to 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, complete saturation of systemic clearance was observed.

It is produced in genetically modified Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using recombinant DNA technology. The 260-amino acid sequence of dornase alfa is identical to the endogenous human enzyme. Dornase alfa cleaves extracellular DNA to 5´-phosphodinucleotide and 5´-phosphooligonucleotide end products without affecting intracellular DNA. In individuals with cystic fibrosis, extracellular DNA, which is an extremely viscous anion, is released by degenerating leukocytes that accumulate during inflammatory responses to infections. Enzymatic breakdown of this extracellular DNA appears to reduce sputum viscosity and viscoelasticity.",143831-71-4,953A26OA1Y,liquid,approved,,Used as adjunct therapy in the treatment of cystic fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease characterized by the retention of viscous purulent secretions in the airways. These thick secretions contribute both to reduced pulmonary function and to frequent pulmonary infection. Purulent pulmonary secretions of individuals with cystic fibrosis contain very high concentrations of extracellular DNA released by degenerating leukocytes that accumulate in response to these infections. Dornase alfa hydrolyzes the DNA in sputum of CF patients and reduces sputum viscosity and viscoelasticity. The enzyme does not appear to affect sputum in the absence of an inflammatory response to infection, nor does it affect the sputum of healthy individuals.","Dornase alfa is a biosynthetic form of human DNase I. The enzyme is involved in endonucleolytic cleavage of extracellular DNA to 5´-phosphodinucleotide and 5´-phosphooligonucleotide end products. It has no effect on intracellular DNA. Optimal activity is dependent on the presence of divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium. Extracellular DNA is a viscous anionic polymer and its breakdown appears to improve the viscosity and viscoelasticity of purulent sputum of individuals with CF, thus reducing airflow obstruction. Dornase alfa does not seem to have any effect on non-purulent sputum.","Adverse reactions occur at a frequency of < 1/1000 and are usually mild and transient in nature. Reported adverse effects include chest pain (pleuritic/non-cardiac), fever, dyspepsia, voice alteration (hoarseness), pharyngitis, dyspnea, laryngitis, rhinitis, decreased lung function, rash, urticaria, and conjunctivitis. There is no evidence of carcinogenic or mutagenic properties. The safety of dornase alfa has not been studied in pregnant women, nursing women and children under the age of 5 years old.","While no conclusive studies have yet been published, dornase alfa is expected to be metabolized by proteases in biofluids.",Studies in rats and monkeys after inhalation of dornase alfa shows very little systemic absorption (less than 15% for rats and less than 2% for monkeys). The results were also witnessed in patients. Dornase alfa is also associated with very low accumulation with no serum concentration greater than 10ng/mL observed no matter the dose administered. Bioavailability: mean sputum concentrations of dornase alfa can be measured after 15 minutes. Onset is achieved within 3 to 7 days. Peak concentrations are achieved after 9 days.,,,,"In studies in rats and monkeys, the initial volume of distribution is similar to the serum volume. Concentrations in sputum decline rapidly after inhalation.","Studies in rats indicate that, following aerosol administration, the disappearance half-life of dornase alfa from the lungs is 11 hours.

small molecule,2005-06-13,2023-01-03,DB00006,Bivalirudin,"Bivalirudin is a synthetic 20 residue peptide (thrombin inhibitor) which reversibly inhibits thrombin. Once bound to the active site, thrombin cannot activate fibrinogen into fibrin, the crucial step in the formation of thrombus. It is administered intravenously. Because it can cause blood stagnation, it is important to monitor changes in hematocrit, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio and blood pressure.",128270-60-0,TN9BEX005G,solid,approved investigational,"Avi Tovi, Chaim Eidelman, Shimon Shushan, Alon Hagi, Alexander Ivchenko, Gabriel-Marcus Butilca, Leah Bar-Oz, Tehila Gadi, Gil Zaovi, ""Process for production of Bivalirudin."" U.S. Patent US20070093423, issued April 26, 2007.","For treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and for the prevention of thrombosis. Bivalirudin is indicated for use in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), in patients at moderate to high risk acute coronary syndromes due to unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation in whom a PCI is planned.",Bivalirudin mediates an inhibitory action on thrombin by directly and specifically binding to both the catalytic site and anion-binding exosite of circulating and clot-bound thrombin. The action of bivalirudin is reversible because thrombin will slowly cleave the thrombin-bivalirudin bond which recovers the active site of thrombin.,"Inhibits the action of thrombin by binding both to its catalytic site and to its anion-binding exosite. Thrombin is a serine proteinase that plays a central role in the thrombotic process, acting to cleave fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and to activate Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa, allowing fibrin to develop a covalently cross-linked framework which stabilizes the thrombus; thrombin also activates Factors V and VIII, promoting further thrombin generation, and activates platelets, stimulating aggregation and granule release.","Based on a study by Gleason et al., the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for bivalirudin, administered to rats via intravenous infusion over a 24-hour period, was 2000 mg/kg/24 h.",80% proteolytic cleavage,"Following intravenous administration, bivalirudin exhibits linear pharmacokinetics.  The mean steady state concentration is 12.3 +/- 1.7mcg/mL after administration of an intravenous bolus of 1mg/kg followd by a 2.5mg/kg/hr intravenous infusion given over 4 hours.","* Normal renal function: 25 min (in normal conditions)

small molecule,2005-06-13,2023-01-03,DB00007,Leuprolide,"Leuprolide is a synthetic 9-residue peptide analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Unlike the endogenous decapeptide GnRH, leuprolide contains a single D-amino acid (D-leucyl) residue, which helps to increase its circulating half-life from three to four minutes to approximately three hours.[A203222] As a GnRH mimic, leuprolide is capable of binding to the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) and inducing downstream modulation of both gonadotropin hormone and sex steroid levels. Prolonged activation of GnRHR results in significant downregulation of sex steroid levels, which is primarily responsible for the clinical efficacy of leuprolide in diverse conditions, including advanced prostate cancer, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty.[A203126, A203132]

Leuprolide was first approved in 1985 as a daily subcutaneous injection under the tradename Lupron™ by Abbvie Endocrine Inc.[L13850] Since this initial approval, various long-acting intramuscular and subcutaneous products have been developed such that patients can be dosed once every six months.[L13781, L13790] Leuprolide remains frontline therapy in all conditions for which it is indicated for use.",53714-56-0,EFY6W0M8TG,solid,approved investigational,"Daniel Kadzimirzs, Gerhard Jas, Volker Autze, ""Solution-Phase Synthesis of Leuprolide and Its Intermediates."" U.S. Patent US20090005535, issued January 01, 2009.","Leuprolide is indicated for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer [L13781, L34415] and as palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer.[L13790] 

It is also used for the treatment of pediatric patients with central precocious puberty (CPP).[L13784, L13787] 

In combination with oral [norethisterone] (also known as norethindrone), leuprolide is also indicated for the initial treatment of the symptoms of endometriosis.[L10310] Finally, in combination with iron supplementation, leuprolide is indicated for the preoperative hematological improvement of anemic patients with uterine leiomyomata (uterine fibroids).[L13814]","Leuprolide is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue that functions as a GnRH receptor superagonist.[A203132, A203222] After an initial spike in GnRH-mediated steroidal production, including testosterone and estradiol, prolonged use results in a significant drop in circulating steroid levels, in line with those produced through other forms of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).[A203126, A203129, A203132] The corresponding hormonal/steroidal changes produce specific adverse effects in different patient populations.

In women undergoing treatment for endometriosis or uterine leiomyomata, careful consideration regarding pregnancy status is advised. The initial increase in estradiol levels may worsen symptoms such as pain and bleeding. Long-term use of leuprolide is associated with loss of bone mineral density. Patients co-administered with [norethisterone] may experience sudden vision loss, proptosis, diplopia, migraine, thrombophlebitis, and pulmonary embolism and may also be at higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Patients with a history of depression may experience severe recurrence of depressive symptoms.[L10310, L13814]

In men undergoing palliative treatment for advanced/metastatic prostate cancer, short-term spikes in testosterone levels may cause tumour flare and associated symptoms such as bone pain, hematuria, neuropathy, bladder and/or ureteral obstruction, and spinal cord compression. In addition, patients are at increased risk of developing hyperglycemia, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, which may manifest through myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac death, or prolonged QT/QTc interval. In addition, Leuprolide may cause convulsions and embryo-fetal toxicity.[L13781, L13790]

In pediatric patients undergoing treatment for central precocious puberty (CPP), the initial steroidal spike may be associated with increased clinical signs of puberty within 2-4 weeks of treatment initiation. In addition, leuprolide may cause convulsions and psychiatric symptoms, including irritability, impatience, aggression, anger, and crying.[L13784, L13787]","Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a naturally occurring decapeptide that modulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. GnRH binds to corresponding receptors (GnRHRs) on the anterior pituitary gonadotropes, which in turn release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH); these, in turn, affect the downstream synthesis and release of the sex hormones testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estrone, and estradiol.[A203126, A203132]

Despite the variety of conditions indicated for treatment with leuprolide, the mechanism of action underlying efficacy is the same in all cases. As a GnRHR agonist, leuprolide binds to and initially activates downstream LH and FSH release; this initial spike in gonadotropin levels is responsible for some of the adverse effects associated with treatment. After 2-4 weeks of treatment, continuous stimulation of GnRHR results in feedback inhibition and significant downregulation of LH, FSH, and their corresponding downstream effects, producing a therapeutic benefit. These effects are reversible upon treatment discontinuation.[A203126, A203129, A203132, A203222, L10310, L13781, L13784, L13787, L13790, L13814]","Leuprolide is considered extremely safe, with low dose-related toxicity and comparatively mild adverse effects.[A203126] Prostate cancer patients treated with leuprolide at doses as high as 20 mg/day for two years showed no additional adverse effects compared to those receiving 1 mg/day.[L13814]","Radiolabeling studies suggest that leuprolide is primarily metabolized to inactive penta-, tri-, and dipeptide entities, which are likely further metabolized. It is expected that various peptidases encountered throughout systemic circulation are responsible for leuprolide metabolism.[L10310, L13781, L13784, L13787, L13790, L13814, L34415]","Leuprolide is typically administered as a single-dose long-acting formulation employing either microsphere or biodegradable solid depot technologies.[A203126] Regardless of the exact formulation and initial dose strength, the C<sub>max</sub> is typically achieved by 4-5 hours post-injection and displays large variability in the range of 4.6 - 212 ng/mL. Eventual steady-state kinetics are typically achieved by four weeks, with a narrower range of 0.1 - 2 ng/mL. No studies on the effects of food on absorption have been carried out.[L10310, L13781, L13784, L13787, L13790, L13814, L34415]","Leuprolide has a terminal elimination half-life of approximately three hours.[L10310, L13781, L13784, L13787, L13790, L13814, L34415]","Leuprolide displays _in vitro_ binding to human plasma proteins between 43% and 49%.[L10310, L13781, L13784, L13787, L13790, L13814, L34415]","Following administration of 3.75 mg leuprolide depot suspension to three patients, less than 5% of the initial dose was recovered as unchanged or pentapeptide metabolite in the urine.[L10310, L13781, L13784, L13814]","Leuprolide has an apparent steady-state volume of distribution of 27 L following intravenous bolus administration to healthy males.

biotech,2005-06-13,2023-01-03,DB00008,Peginterferon alfa-2a,"Peginterferon alfa-2a is a form of recombinant interferon used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) resulting in less use of Peginterferon alfa-2a. Peginterferon alfa-2a is derived from the alfa-2a moeity of recombinant human interferon and acts by binding to human type 1 interferon receptors. Activation and dimerization of this receptor induces the body's innate antiviral response by activating the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. Use of Peginterferon alfa-2a is associated with a wide range of severe adverse effects including the aggravation and development of endocrine and autoimmune disorders, retinopathies, cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric complications, and increased risk of hepatic decompensation in patients with cirrhosis. The use of Peginterferon alfa-2a has largely declined since newer interferon-free antiviral therapies have been developed.

In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) no longer recommend Peginterferon alfa-2a for the treatment of Hepatitis C [A19593]. Peginterferon alfa-2a was used alongside [DB00811] with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 48 weeks of therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].

Peginterferon alfa-2a is available as a fixed dose injector (tradename Pegasys) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in 2002 by the FDA, Pegasys is indicated for the treatment of HCV with [DB00811] or other antiviral drugs [FDA Label]. When combined together, Peginterferon alfa-2a and [DB00811] have been shown to achieve a SVR between 36% for genotype 1 and 59% for genotypes 2-6 after 48 weeks of treatment.",198153-51-4,Q46947FE7K,liquid,approved investigational,,"Peginterferon alfa-2a is indicated for the treatment of HCV in combination with other antiviral drugs in patients over 5 years of age with compensated liver disease [FDA Label]. May be used as a monotherapy in patients with contraindications to or significant intolerance to other anti-viral therapies.

Peginterferon alfa-2a is also indicated as a monotherapy for adult patients with HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B infection who have compensated liver disease and evidence of viral replication and liver inflammation [FDA Label].",Peginterferon alfa-2a induces the body's innate antiviral response [FDA Label].,Peginterferon alfa-2a is derived from recombinant human interferon's alfa-2a moeity [FDA Label]. It binds to and activates human type 1 interferon receptors causing them to dimerize. This activates the JAK/STAT pathway. Activation of the JAK/STAT pathway increases expression of multiple genes in multiple tissues involved in the innate antiviral response.,"Peginterferon alfa-2a may manifest neuropsychiatric complications include suicide, suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, depression, relapse of drug addiction, and drug overdose [FDA Label]. Hypertension, supraventricular arrhythmias, chest pain, and myocardial infarction have been observed in patients using Peginterferon alfa-2a. Peginterferon alfa-2a may produce myelosuppression as well as the development or aggravation of autoimmune disorders including myositis, hepatitis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, interstitial nephritis, thyroiditis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Peginterferon alfa-2a causes or aggravates hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and diabetes mellitus have been observed to develop in patients treated with Peginterferon alfa-2a. Peginterferon alfa-2a may decrease or produce loss of vision, retinopathy including macular edema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis, retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots, optic neuritis, papilledema and serous retinal detachment. Peginterferon mayy be related to increased ischemic and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular events. Patients with cirrhosis on Peginterferon alfa-2a are at risk of hepatic decompensation. Dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonia, bronchiolitis obliterans, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension and sarcoidosis may be induced or aggravated by Peginterferon alfa-2a. Serious and severe infections (bacterial, viral, or fungal) have been reported during treatment with Peginterferon alfa-2a. Ulcerative and hemorrhagic/ischemic colitis have been observed within 12 weeks of starting Peginterferon alfa-2a treatment. Pancreatitis and peripheral nephropathy have also been reported. Peginterferon alfa-2a is associated with growth inhibition in pediatric patients. Use of Peginterferon alfa-2a while pregant may result in delopmental abnormalities or death of the fetus.",,Peginterferon alfa-2a reaches peak plasma concentration 72-96 hours after subcutaneous administration [FDA Label]. Trough concentrations at week 48 are approximately 2 fold higher than week 1. The peak to trough ratio at week 48 is 2.,The mean terminal half-life of peginterferon alfa-2a is 164 in a range of 84-353 hours [FDA Label].,,,,The mean systemic clearance of peginterferon alfa-2a is

biotech,2005-06-13,2023-01-03,DB00009,Alteplase,"Alteplase is a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) used as a thrombolytic agent.[L43125] It cleaves plasminogen to form plasmin, an enzyme involved in the degradation of fibrin clots. In the absence of fibrin, the alteplase-mediated conversion of plasminogen is limited, thanks to the high affinity between alteplase and fibrin.[A252330,L43125] Alteplase is a purified glycoprotein of 527 amino acids expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.[A252345,L43125] It was first approved by the FDA in 1987 for the management of thromboembolic disease, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI).[A252270] The use of alteplase to manage AMI has decreased thanks to the availability of safer treatments such as angioplasty and stenting. However, its use for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) has increased over the years.[A252340] New thrombolytic agents derived from tissue plasminogen activator, such as [desmoteplase], [tenecteplase] and [reteplase], have also been developed.[A252270,A252345] Alteplase is also available as Cathflo Activase (intracatheter instillation) for the restoration of function to central venous access devices.[L34864]",105857-23-6,1RXS4UE564,liquid,approved investigational,"Goeddel, DV., et al. (1988). Human tissue plasminogen activator (U.S. Patent No. 4,766,075 A). U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a7/38/45/ec3813293b05c5/US4766075.pdf","Alteplase is indicated for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and for use in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for the reduction of mortality and incidence of heart failure. Alteplase is also indicated for the lysis of acute massive pulmonary embolism, defined as acute pulmonary emboli obstructing blood flow to a lobe or multiple lung segments, and acute pulmonary emboli accompanied by unstable hemodynamics.[L43125]","Alteplase binds to fibrin and plasminogen. Alteplase specificity for fibrin is achieved thanks to its high affinity for lysine residues. Also, it can bind plasminogen via loop structures called kringles, stabilized by three disulphide linkages similar to the ones in plasminogen. The specificity of alteplase for plasminogen bound to fibrin allows this drug to act in a clot- or fibrin-specific manner, leading to low concentrations of circulating plasmin and a lower risk of hemorrhagic transformation.[A252270,A252330] 

In patients with acute myocardial infarction, alteplase reduces fibrinogen levels 3 to 6 hours after treatment. In patients with acute ischemic stroke, patients treated with alteplase have a significantly higher resolution of hyperdense artery sign, a marker of clot formation in the proximal middle cerebral artery, compared to those treated with placebo.[A252330] The use of alteplase increases the risk of bleeding and thromboembolic events. Rare cases of cholesterol embolism have also been reported.[L43125]","Alteplase is a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) that converts plasminogen to plasmin in a fibrin-dependent process. In the absence of fibrin, alteplase converts a limited amount of plasminogen. However, in the presence of fibrin clots, alteplase binds to fibrin and cleaves the arginine-valine bond at positions 560 and 561 of plasminogen, converting it into its active form, plasmin. Plasmin in turn degrades the fibrin matrix of the thrombus and promotes clot dissolution.[A252270] Alteplase initiates local fibrinolysis with limited systemic proteolysis.[L43125]","Toxicity information regarding alteplase is not readily available. Patients experiencing an overdose are at an increased risk of severe adverse effects such as risk of bleeding and thromboembolic events.[L43125] Symptomatic and supportive measures are recommended. The carcinogenic potential of alteplase or its effect on fertility have not been evaluated. _In vivo_ studies evaluating tumorigenicity and _in vitro_ studies evaluating mutagenicity were negative.[L43125] It has been estimated that the acute oral and dermal toxicity of alteplase is above 5,000 mg/kg.[L43175]","Alteplase is mainly metabolized by the liver. The carbohydrate and polypeptide domains of alteplase interact with hepatic glycoprotein receptors, leading to receptor-mediated endocytosis.[A252270] _In vivo_ studies suggest that alteplase follows zero-order kinetics, meaning that its metabolism is saturable at higher plasma concentrations.[A252270]","Healthy volunteers with a baseline endogenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) of 3.3 ng/ml had a 290-fold increase in baseline concentrations after receiving alteplase at an infusion rate of 0.25 mg/kg for 30 min; with an infusion rate of 0.5 mg/kg, a 550-fold increase was observed.[A252270] Acute myocardial infarction patients (n=12) given 10 mg of alteplase in a 2-minute infusion reached a peak plasma concentration of 3310 ng/ml. This was followed by 50 mg of alteplase in 1 h and 30 mg in 1.5 h, resulting in steady-state plasma levels of 2210 ng/ml and 930 ng/ml, respectively.[A252285]",Alteplase has an initial half-life of less than 5 minutes in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The dominant initial plasma half-life of the 3-hour and the accelerated regimens for AMI are similar.[L43125],Not available.,"In healthy volunteers, more than 80% of alteplase is eliminated through urine 18 hours after administration.[A252270]","The initial volume of distribution approximates plasma volume.[L43125] The average volume of distribution of the central compartment goes from 3.9 to 4.3 L, and the volume of distribution at steady state goes from 7.2 to 12 L.[A252270]",Alteplase has a plasma clearance between 380 and 570 mL/min.[L43125],OPHTHALMOLOGICALS OTHER OPHTHALMOLOGICALS SENSORY ORGANS Enzymes Other ophthalmologicals ANTITHROMBOTIC AGENTS BLOOD AND BLOOD FORMING ORGANS,,,"Avoid herbs and supplements with anticoagulant/antiplatelet activity.

Erythropoietin interacts with
progenitor stem cells to increase red cell production. Binding of erythropoietin to the erythropoietin receptor leads to receptor dimerization, which facilitates activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathways within the cytosol.

small molecule,2005-06-13,2023-01-03,DB00014,Goserelin,"Goserelin is a synthetic hormone. In men, it stops the production of the hormone testosterone, which may stimulate the growth of cancer cells. In women, goserelin decreases the production of the hormone estradiol (which may stimulate the growth of cancer cells) to levels similar to a postmenopausal state. When the medication is stopped, hormone levels return to normal.",65807-02-5,0F65R8P09N,solid,approved,"Kripa S. Srivastava, Matthew R. Davis, ""Solid Phase Peptide for the Production of Goserelin."" U.S. Patent US20100311946, issued December 09, 2010.","Goserelin is indicated for:

- Use in combination with flutamide for the management of locally confined carcinoma of the prostate
- Palliative treatment of advanced carcinoma of the prostate
- The management of endometriosis
- Use as an endometrial-thinning agent prior to endometrial ablation for dysfunctional uterine bleeding
- Use in the palliative treatment of advanced breast cancer in pre- and perimenopausal women","The pharmacokinetics of goserelin have been determined in both male and female healthy volunteers and patients. In these studies, goserelin was administered as a single 250µg (aqueous solution) dose and as a single or multiple 3.6 mg depot dose by subcutaneous route.",Goserelin is a synthetic decapeptide analogue of LHRH. Goserelin acts as a potent inhibitor of pituitary gonadotropin secretion when administered in the biodegradable formulation. The result is sustained suppression of LH and serum testosterone levels.,No experience of overdosage from clinical trials.,Hepatic,"Inactive orally, rapidly absorbed following subcutaneous administration.",4-5 hours,27.3%,Clearance of goserelin following subcutaneous administration of a radiolabeled solution of goserelin was very rapid and occurred via a combination of hepatic and urinary excretion. More than 90% of a subcutaneous radiolabeled solution formulation dose of goserelin was excreted in urine.,* 44.1 ± 13.6 L [subcutaneous administration of 250 mcg],* 121 +/- 42.4 mL/min [prostate

biotech,2005-06-13,2023-01-03,DB00016,Erythropoietin,"Erythropoietin (EPO) is a growth factor produced in the kidneys that stimulates the production of red blood cells. It works by promoting the division and differentiation of committed erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow [FDA Label]. Epoetin alfa (Epoge) was developed by Amgen Inc. in 1983 as the first rhEPO commercialized in the United States, followed by other alfa and beta formulations. Epoetin alfa is a 165-amino acid erythropoiesis-stimulating glycoprotein produced in cell culture using recombinant DNA technology and is used for the treatment of patients with anemia associated with various clinical conditions, such as chronic renal failure, antiviral drug therapy, chemotherapy, or a high risk for perioperative blood loss from surgical procedures [FDA Label]. It has a molecular weight of approximately 30,400 daltons and is produced by mammalian cells into which the human erythropoietin gene has been introduced. The product contains the identical amino acid sequence of isolated natural erythropoietin and has the same biological activity as the endogenous erythropoietin. Epoetin alfa biosimilar, such as Retacrit (epoetin alfa-epbx or epoetin zeta), has been formulated to allow more access to treatment options for patients in the market [L2784]. The biosimilar is approved by the FDA and EMA as a safe, effective and affordable biological product and displays equivalent clinical efficacy, potency, and purity to the reference product [A7504]. Epoetin alfa formulations can be administered intravenously or subcutaneously.",11096-26-7,64FS3BFH5W,liquid,approved,,"Indicated in adult and paediatric patients for the: 

- treatment of anemia due to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in patients on dialysis and not on dialysis.
- treatment of anemia due to zidovudine in patients with HIV-infection. 
- treatment of anemia due to the effects of concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and upon initiation, there is a minimum of two additional months of planned chemotherapy.
- reduction of allogeneic RBC transfusions in patients undergoing elective, noncardiac, nonvascular surgery.","Erythropoietin and epoetin alfa are involved in the regulation of erythrocyte differentiation and the maintenance of a physiological level of circulating erythrocyte mass. It is reported to increase the reticulocyte count within 10 days of initiation, followed by increases in the RBC count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, usually within 2 to 6 weeks [F85]. Depending on the dose administered, the rate of hemoglobin increase may vary. In patients receiving hemodialysis, a greater biologic response is not observed at doses exceeding 300 Units/kg 3 times weekly [F85]. 

Epoetin alfa serves to restore erythropoietin deficiency in pathological and other clinical conditions where normal production of erythropoietin is impaired or compromised. In anemic patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), administration with epoetin alfa stimulated erythropoiesis by increasing the reticulocyte count within 10 days, followed by increases in the red cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, usually within 2 to 6 weeks [FDA Label]. Epoetin alfa was shown to be effective in increasing hematocrit in zidovudine-treated HIV-infected patients and anemic cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy [FDA Label].","Erythropoietin or exogenous epoetin alfa binds to the erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R) and activates intracellular signal transduction pathways [A33079]. The affinity (Kd) of EPO for its receptor on human cells is ∼100 to 200 pM [A33080]. Upon binding to EPO-R on the surface of erythroid progenitor cells, a conformational change is induced which brings EPO-R-associated Janus family tyrosine protein kinase 2 (JAK2) molecules into close proximity. JAK2 molecules are subsequently activated via phosphorylation, then phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the EPO-R that serve as docking sites for Src homology 2-domain-containing intracellular signaling proteins [A33079]. The signalling proteins include STAT5 that once phosphorylated by JAK2, dissociates from the EPO-R, dimerizes, and translocates to the nucleus where they serve as transcription factors to activate target genes involved in cell division or differentiation, including the apoptosis inhibitor Bcl-x [A33079]. The inhibition of apoptosis by the EPO-activated JAK2/STAT5/Bcl-x pathway is critical in erythroid differentiation. Via JAK2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, erythropoietin and epoetin alfa also activates other intracellular proteins involved in erythroid cell proliferation and survival, such as Shc , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and phospholipase C-γ1 [A33079].","Overdose from epoetin alfa include signs and symptoms associated with an excessive and/or rapid increase in hemoglobin concentration, including cardiovascular events. Patients with suspected or known overdose should be monitored closely for cardiovascular events and hematologic abnormalities. Polycythemia should be managed acutely with phlebotomy, as clinically indicated. Following resolution of the overdose, reintroduction of epoetin alfa therapy should be accompanied by close monitoring for evidence of rapid increases in hemoglobin concentration (>1 gm/dL per 14 days). In patients with an excessive hematopoietic response, reduce the dose in accordance with the recommendations described in the drug label [FDA Label].","Binding of erythropoietin and epoetin alfa to EPO-R leads to cellular internalization, which involves the degradation of the ligand. Erythropoietin and epoetin alfa may also be degraded by the reticuloendothelial scavenging pathway or lymphatic system [A33080].","The time to reach peak concentration is slower via the subcutaneous route than the intravenous route which ranges from 20 to 25 hours, and the peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (5–10% of those seen with IV administration).[A33080] The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable erythropoietin is much lower than that of the intravenously administered product and is approximately 20-40%.[A33080]

**Adult and paediatric patients with CRF:** Following subcutaneous administration, the peak plasma levels are achieved within 5 to 24 hours [FDA Label]. 

**Cancer patients receiving cyclic chemotherapy:** The average time to reach peak plasma concentration was approximately 13.3 ± 12.4 hours after 150 Units/kg three times per week (TIW) subcutaneous (SC) dosing. The Cmax is expected be 3- to 7- fold higher and the Tmax is expected to be 2- to 3-fold longer in patients receiving a 40,000 Units SC weekly dosing regimen [FDA Label].","**Healthy volunteers:** The half life is approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers receiving an intravenous injection [F85]. A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children [F85].

**Adult and paediatric patients with CRF:** The elimination half life following intravenous administration ranges from 4 to 13 hours, which is about 20% longer in CRF patients than that in healthy subjects. The half life is reported to be similar between adult patients receiving or not receiving dialysis [FDA Label]. 

**Cancer patients receiving cyclic chemotherapy:** Following subcutaneous administration, the average half life is 40 hours with range of 16 to 67 hours [FDA Label].",No information of serum protein binding available.,"Erythropoietin and epoetin alfa are cleared via uptake and degradation via the EPO-R-expressing cells, and may also involve other cellular pathways in the interstitium, probably via cells in the reticuloendothelial scavenging pathway or lymphatic system [A33080]. Only a small amount of unchanged epoetin alfa is found in the urine [F86].","In healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution of intravenous epoetin alfa was generally similar to the plasma volume (range of 40–63.80 mL/kg), indicating limited extravascular distribution [A33080, A33076].","**Healthy volunteers: ** In male volunteers receiving intravenous epoetin alfa, the total body clearance was approximately 8.12 ± 1.00 mL/h/kg [A33076]. 

**Cancer patients receiving cyclic chemotherapy:** The average clearance was approximately 20.2 ± 15.9 mL/h/kg after 150 Units/kg three times per week (TIW) subcutaneous (SC) dosing [FDA Label].

biotech,2005-06-13,2023-01-03,DB00017,Salmon calcitonin,"Synthetic peptide, 32 residues long formulated as a nasal spray.",47931-85-1,7SFC6U2VI5,liquid,approved investigational,"Marcos C. Poblet, Berta P. Obiols, Gemma J. Farres, ""Procedure for preparing salmon calcitonin."" U.S. Patent US5527881, issued October, 1991.","Used in the treatment of symptomatic Paget's disease for patients unresponsive to alternate treatments or intolerant to such treatments. In addition, it is used in emergency situations when serum calcium levels must be decreased quickly until the underlying condition is identified. It can also be added to existing therapeutic regimens for hypercalcemia such as intravenous fluids and furosemide, oral phosphate or corticosteroids, or other agents. Calcitonin can be used in patients with azotemia and cases where intravenous fluids would be contraindicated due to limited cardiac reserves. Also for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis in women more than 5 years post-menopause.","Calcitonin inhibits bone resorption by osteoclasts (bone remodeling cells) and promotes bone formation by osteoblasts. This leads to a net increase in bone mass and a reduction in plasma calcium levels. It also promotes the renal excretion of ions such as calcium, phosphate, sodium, magnesium, and potassium by decreasing tubular reabsorption. In consequence, there is an increase in the jejunal secretion of water, sodium, potassium, and chloride.","Calcitonin binds to the calcitonin receptor (found primarily in osteoclasts) which then enhances the production of vitamin D producing enzymes (25-hydroxyvitamine D-24-hydroxylase), leading to greater calcium retention and enhanced bone density. Binding of calcitonin to its receptor also activates adenylyl cyclase and the phosphatidyl-inositol-calcium pathway.","Salmon calcitonin was shown to inhibit lactation in animals and is not recommend in nursing mothers. While research in animals have shown a decrease in fetal weight, no studies have yet shown similar results in humans. It is recommended however to proceed carefully when administering salmon calcitonin to pregnant women and consider if the benefits outweigh the risks. Because of its protein nature, salmon calcitonin may provoke an allergy reaction (bronchospams and swelling of the tongue/throat) that can turn into a full-blown anaphylactic response. The manufacturer also reports an increase in the risk of malignancies from oral route (0.7%) to intranasal route (2.4%) compared to placebo. The same may apply to IV, IM and SC routes since the systemic exposure is higher in those cases.
Nausea is noticeable in some patients but tends to decrease with continued administration. Rhinitis, headaches and back pain have also been reported among others.",Salmon calcitonin primarily undergoes degradation in the kidneys to form pharmacologically inactive metabolites. It is also metabolized in the blood and the peripheral tissue.,"Salmon calcitonin is rapidly absorbed with bioavailability of 71% following subcutaneous injection and 66% following intramuscular injection in humans. Via the nasal route, the bioavailability varies between 3 to 5% relative to IM.",Half-life elimination (terminal): I.M. 58 minutes; SubQ 59 to 64 minutes; Nasal: ~18 to 23 minutes,Protein binding is about 30 to 40%.,"Urine.

biotech,2005-06-13,2022-12-06,DB00019,Pegfilgrastim,"Pegfilgrastim is a PEGylated form of the recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) analogue, [filgrastim].[A187601] The drug is approved for use to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in susceptible patients with with non-myeloid cancer receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer treatment.[L9746] Although the risk of developing febrile neutropenia is less than 20% in many readily used chemotherapy regimens,[A248855] infections pose risks of hospitalization and mortalities.[A187631] Due to the relatively short circulating half-life of filgrastim, a 20 kDa PEG moiety was covalently conjugated to the N-terminus of filgrastim (at the methionine residue) to develop longer-acting pegfilgrastim.[A29,A187607] Due to a longer half-life and slower elimination rate than filgrastim, pegfilgrastim requires less frequent dosing than filgrastim; however, pegfilgrastim has a comparable pharmacological activity to filgrastim and binds to the G-CSF receptor to stimulate the proliferation, differentiation, and activation of neutrophils.[A187607]

First developed by Amgen, pegfilgrastim was initially approved by the FDA in 2002 and marketed as Neulasta. It is typically administered via a subcutaneous injection. There are several pegfilgrastim biosimilars (Fulphila, Pelgraz or Lapelga, Pelmeg, Udenyca, Ziextenzo, Grasustek, Fylnetra, Stimufend) by Health Canada, European Union (EU), and FDA that are approved to reduce infection risk.[L9779,L9785,L43050] These biosimilars are highly similar to the reference product, Neulasta, in terms of pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profile and conditions of use.[L9974]",208265-92-3,3A58010674,liquid,approved,,"Pegfilgrastim is indicated to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in patients with non­ myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia.[L44221]

It is also indicated to increase survival in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation (Hematopoietic Subsyndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome).[L44221]","Pegfilgrastim is a recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) that promotes the production, proliferation, and maturation of neutrophils, which are white blood cells involved in both innate and adaptive immune responses.[A187631,A248855] The safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim in reducing the risk of febrile neutropenia and infections have been demonstrated in various tumor types and settings.[A187631] 

During chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, the clearance of pegfilgrastim is significantly reduced and the concentration of pegfilgrastim is sustained until the onset of neutrophil recovery.[A29] Serum concentrations of pegfilgrastim decline as the neutrophil count increases as neutrophil and neutrophil precursors are involved in cell-mediated clearance of the drug.[A187601] Due the addition of polyethylene glycol group to its structure, Pegfilgrastim is a long-acting form of filgrastim with an extended serum half-life and reduced renal clearance.[A187607] Although it is more slowly absorbed than filgrastim, self-regulation of pegfilgrastim is more efficient and the drug effects are maintained during one chemotherapy cycle (2-3 weeks).[A29]","Neutrophils are short-lived immune cells that are highly susceptible to cell death following myelosuppressive chemotherapy. This marked reduction in neutrophil numbers during chemotherapy increases the risk of hospitalization, infection, and infection-related mortality. It also directly impacts the clinical outcome of patients if cases of febrile neutropenia requires dose reductions or schedule delay of chemotherapy, thus reducing the clinical efficacy of chemotherapy and patient benefit from receiving appropriate treatment.[A187631] 

G-CSF is an endogenous haematopoietic growth factor that stimulates granulopoietic cells of the neutrophil lineage. Pegfilgrastim mimics its biological actions and binds to the same G-CSF receptor expressed on cells of myeloid lineage, such as granulocytic precursors and mature neutrophils.[A29] Upon binding of the ligand, G-CSF receptor undergoes a conformational change and activates several downstream signalling pathways including JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK.[A187868] These pathways work to increase proliferation and differentiation of granulocyte progenitor cells, induce maturation of the progenitor cells, and enhance survival and function of mature neutrophils.[A29]","The maximum safe dose of pegfilgrastim has not been established; however, the highest dose used in clinical trials was 300 mcg/kg.[A248855] Overdosage of pegfilgrastim may result in leukocytosis and bone pain. Events of edema, dyspnea, and pleural effusion have been reported in a single patient who self-administered pegfilgrastim on 8 consecutive days in error. In the event of overdose, the patient should be monitored for signs and symptoms of toxicity and responded with appropriate general supportive care.[L9746,A248855]","It is not know whether pegfilgrastim is metabolized into major metabolites.[L10022] Once it binds to the therapeutic target, pegfilgrastim is internalized by the neutrophil and undergoes nonspecific degradation.[A29]",Pegfilgrastim has a lower absolute bioavailability than filgrastim following subcutaneous administration. The absorption of pegfilgrastim is largely dependent on the lymphatic system due to the attached PEG group contributing to the large size of the drug. It is slowly absorbed following subcutaneous administration with a time to peak concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) of about one to two days.[A29],"The serum half-life of Pegfilgrastim is highly variable depending on the absolute neutrophil count, with the range of 15 to 80 hours following subcutaneous administration. The median serum half-life of 42 hours.[A187607,L9746]",The plasma protein binding of pegfilgrastim is unlikely.[L10022],"The polyethylene glycol moiety limits the renal clearance by glomerular filtration of pegfilgrastim, making neutrophil-mediated clearance as the predominant route of elimination.[A187607] This elimination pathway is initiated by the binding of pegfilgrastim to the G-CSF receptor on the neutrophil cell surface, leading to the internalization of the pegfilgrastim-receptor complex via endocytosis and subsequent degradation inside the cell. While hepatic clearance has not been well characterized for pegfilgrastim, its non-PEGylated precursor filgrastim is known to be unaffected by changes in hepatic clearance.[A29]",Pegfilgrastim appears to have a volume of distribution of approximately 170 L.[A33290],"Pegfilgrastim has a self-regulating clearance that involves neutrophil-induced clearance.[A29,A187631] The clearance is dependent on the number of neutrophils and body weight of the patient: the clearance increases with increasing number of granulocytes and lower body weights.[L9746] Pegfilgrastim is not eliminated from the circulation until neutrophils start to recover following chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and its clearance is increased as neutrophil counts also increase.[A187631] The apparent serum clearance is 14 mL/h/kg.[L10022]",ANTINEOPLASTIC AND IMMUNOMODULATING AGENTS Colony stimulating factors IMMUNOSTIMULANTS,,,,DB00022 DB09329 DB00570 DB11641 DB08904 DB09107 DB14712 DB04895 DB12842 DB06811 DB09122 DB11661 DB01030 DB11567 DB00008 DB00531 DB12814 DB06611 DB06022 DB00059 DB14700 DB09208 DB13933 DB11707 DB06325 DB00082 DB12839 DB08894 DB00309 DB06293 DB13200 DB00541 DB12258 DB12578 DB00061 DB03394 DB05168 DB16007 DB00361 DB05202 DB09287 DB05321 DB05860 DB01839 DB13374,"> Pegfilgrastim sequence
